"tabby cats paradise" is a website i built for folks who love tabby cats. on the site, people can learn about adopting tabby cats, check out a gallery filled with pictures of these cats, and find ways to get in touch with us. i made sure the website is easy to use whether you're on your phone or computer.

how i designed it:

i wanted the website to feel as cozy and inviting as a tabby cat's purr. i chose calming colors and kept everything simple and easy to read with the 'arial' font. i used bootstrap, which is like a toolkit for building websites, to help with the layout and make sure everything looked good.

making the website work on any device:

it was super important to me that the website worked well no matter what device someone used to visit it. with bootstrap, i could make sure the website would adjust to fit the screen whether it was a phone, tablet, or desktop. i made the menu shrink down into a little button on smaller screens, and i arranged the cat photos to look great no matter the screen size.

some tough parts:

getting the big picture at the top (the hero image) to look just right on all different screens was a bit tricky. i mixed some of bootstrap's options with my own styling to fix it. also, making sure the form where people can contact us worked well and looked nice took some doing, especially getting the form validation right.

how to check out the website:

you can see the website live http://127.0.0.1:3000/lab10.html , and just look around and try things out. server or use an extension in your code editor that lets you preview web pages.

building this website taught me a ton, especially about making sites that work well no matter where you view them from. bootstrap was a huge help. i'm already thinking about what i can add next to make the site even better, like more interactive stuff or more info on taking care of tabby cats.
